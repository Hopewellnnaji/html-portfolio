<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Well, I guess most biographies start off with the nomenclature intel. 
  You perhaps, could already guess my name, by just a glance at my ever first website, build solely off Hypertext Markup Language. 
  Just for the purose of emphasis, I am Hopewell Nnaji, and it is a pleasure to meet you. Somewhere in western Africa, I was born into a christian family, in the south eastern region of the sole giant of the African continent.
  I am innately Igbo, and can speak English, French, German and Spanish fluently. 
  It may interest you to know that I am a Pharmacist by profession, trained and currently practicing as a retail Pharmacist in Nigeria.
  I love reading, swimming and playing chess.</p>
